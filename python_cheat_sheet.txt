IMPORTANT:
- Best to use ATOM because it is an advanced IDE and you can invoke a terminal session in a split window
How to use: 
 -open a folder
 -rightclick and choose RUN CURRENT PYTHON FILE IN TERMINAL
 -split the terminal window and start python in the split window to have a terminal session and 
  and a Python session
- NOTE: Command line does not work in Bash

INVOKE PYTHON: from any CMD line type python or python.exe (3.7.2 is installed)
exit python ctl-z-return or exit() 

HOW TO USE PYTHON COMMAND LINE
(NOTE: command line does not work in Bash)
- invoke cmd
- cd to working directory
- python.exe

HOW TO EXECUTE A SCRIPT
- Start CMD or Bash
- cd /c/Users/johns/onedrive/git/python-mega-course-udemy  
  cd c:/Users/johns/onedrive/git/python-mega-course-udemy
- pythoncd  <script_name>.py

FRAMEWORK,LIBRARIES, PACKAGES and MODULES

MODULE is a file which contains python functions , global variables etc. It is nothing but .py file which has python executable code / statement. Modules and libraries are imported in the python program. dir(<module name>)


LIBRARY is collection of various packages. There is no difference between package and python library conceptually. Modules and libraries are imported in the python program. "from <library name> import <module name>" 

PACKAGE is a third party library that does not come installed with Python. It is a directory which contains a special file __init__.py. I.e., a Python package is a directory with modules in it. Packages are large third party worlds unto themselve and do not come installed with Python. You "pip install <package name>" on the Python command line then you import the package in the Python program. Pip will go and find the package and install it on your computer. help(<package name>)

FRAMEWORK is a collection of various libraries which architects the code flow. The defining characteristic of a framework is Inversion of Control. The framework calls Python and not the other way round.

- library install - pip install library 
- module help - dir(<module name>)
- to use a module: import <module name>' at the top of the program
- method help - help
(module.method)
- List of builtin functions - dir(__builtins__)
FUNCTIONS VS MODULES: Modules have methods and are invoked by object.<append> and functions are invoked by <invoke>(object)

OOP - CLASSES
- METHOD is a function associated with a class
- ATRIBUTE is data associated with a class
- INSTANCE VARIABLE is unique to each instance of a class
- CLASS VARIABLE is common to all instances of a class
- HELP for a specific class:  print(help(<class-name>))

JUPYTER
To launch from File Explorer - 
- <shif><right click> and select Git Bash Here or Open Powershell Here 
- then type "py -m notebook" or "py -m -3 notebook"
- select Python3 from <New> dropdown
- clinck on <Untitled> to rename the notebook



COMMANDS
- exit   clt-Z or exit() and <return>

HELP
-To find out what attributes a type has:
    dir(str)
    dir(list)
    dir(dict)
-To find out what Python builtin functions there are:
    1) dir(__builtins__) "for BUILTIN modules written in C which do not have to be imported"
	2) import sys        "for BUILTIN modules written in C which MUST be imported"
       sys.builtin_module_names
	3) sys.prefix        "for BUILTIN modules written in PYTHON which MUST be imported"
	   Which will return C:\Users\johns\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37
	   go to <lib> directory where you will find more builtins written in python
-Documentation for a Python command can be found with:
    help(str)
    help(str.replace)
    help(dict.values)


For help in Jupyter, put the <command>?

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
Jupyter Notebook does  launches browser with blank page:
-First cut and paste URL in Firefox or IE
If that doesn't work:
-launch Norton
-log into account
-go to Settings and uncheck all boxes
-click on Security and hit the down arrow to minimize security and select Advanced and disable everything Until System Restart
Now cut and paste URL in Firefox or IE
